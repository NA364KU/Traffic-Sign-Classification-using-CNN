# Traffic Sign Classification using CNN

With the rise of self-driving cars, there is a need to accurately detect the environment. Many companies opt for camera based detection rather than LiDAR. This means that image processing methods such as using neural networks are needed.

The dataset used consists of traffic signs from German roads: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

This model uses a pair of convolution and pooling layers each, and 2 dropoutlayers to achieve a testing accuracy of 94.5%
